# Iteratively_Reweighted_Kernel_Machines
# Demo 📐

This repo contains a **minimal, self‑contained PyTorch implementation** of the
Iteratively Reweighted Kernel Machines (IRKM) toy experiment described in the paper
[Iteratively reweighted kernel machines efficiently learn sparse functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08277).

A more complete version will follow soon.
