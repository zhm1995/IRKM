# Iteratively_Reweighted_Kernel_Machines
# Demo 📐

This repo contains a **minimal, self‑contained PyTorch implementation** of the
Iteratively Reweighted Kernel Machines (IRKM) toy experiment described in
our upcoming paper.  The goal is to keep the core logic short and readable; a
more complete version will follow soon.
